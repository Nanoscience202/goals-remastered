# Goals-remastered
A better goal making website I made. It's a personal project to learn and get better at: html, css, css animations, vanilla js, 
typescript, popular animation javascript libraries such as [anime.js](https://animejs.com) and [KUTE.js](https://thednp.github.io/kute.js/),
 MVC pattern. <br />
Will remake this website with React after learning React.
